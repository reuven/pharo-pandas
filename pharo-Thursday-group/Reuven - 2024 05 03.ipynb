    "\n",
    "- If the cell is in \"edit mode,\" then anything I type is actually put into the cell. You can tell that it's in edit mode because of the blue outline around the cell, and the white background in the cell. You can enter edit mode by pressing ENTER or by clicking inside of the cell.\n",
    "- If the cell is in \"command mode,\" then anything I type is taken to be a command to Jupyter itself. You can enter command mode by pressing ESC or by clicking to the left of the cell. You can tell it's in command mode by the lack of a blue outline around the cell, and a gray background in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm editing, then I might be editing code and I might be editing Markdown text (like right now). When you press shift+ENTER, that forces the cell to be \"executed,\" meaning the Python code is run or the Markdown is displayed nicely.\n",
