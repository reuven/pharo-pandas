    "# What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a great high-level language -- it has useful data structures, it is very consistent, and it's even very forgiving when we make mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this all comes with many trade-offs. For example, Python uses a lot more memory than other languages, such as C. It also takes much more time for Python code to execute than C, Java, or C# code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which raises the question: Why in the world would we be using Python to analyze our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: NumPy and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a Python module that's 95% written in C. It basically exposes C data structures to us via a very thin layer of Python. We can thus benefit from the ease of Python but the speed and efficiency of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the most important piece of code for numeric and scientific computing. There's a whole package called SciPy which has functions built up around NumPy's data structures, so that engineers, scientists, and mathematicians can do their calculations quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is very low level. You get the data structure, and then you have to do the work yourself. Pandas provides us with lots of convenient methods to work with NumPy at a higher level. Pandas knows how to perform many more calculations, many more advanced functions with strings, dates, and plotting. Also, retrieving and setting data more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is thus this great compromise, allowing us to use Python and high-level functionality but also get the speed and efficiency of NumPy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas allows us to:\n",
    "- Read data from a wide variety of formats and sources\n",
    "- Clean the data\n",
    "- Analyze the data in numerous ways\n",
    "- Write our analysis out to different formats and outputs\n",
    "- Create visualizations of our work in charts and graphs\n",
