    "1. One specific, unique point in time, specified with year/month/day and hour/minute/second. Of course, you can get even more precise than that. Examples: Time of birth. Time of death. When you graduated university. When a meeting starts. Each of these things is a unique point in time, and you can specify when precisely it happened. When we keep track of these on a computer, they're known as either a `datetime` value or a `timestamp`. "
