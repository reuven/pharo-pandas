These are known as `datetime` or `timestamp` values in different programming languges and databases.\n",
    "2. A span of time, between two points. This isn't unique, and doesn't have a year/month/day, but it does have a volume, which we measure with minutes, seconds, hours, years, etc. This describes a lifespan, or the amount of time you were in school, or how long a meeting went. These are known as `timedeltas` or `intervals` in programming languages and systems.\n",
